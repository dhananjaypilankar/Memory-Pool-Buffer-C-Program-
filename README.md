# Memory-Pool-Buffer-C-Program-
This code helps you create buffer with fixed sizes, every time you allocate a buffer it will give you fixed sized section of memory area. There are function to access these memory area viz. mempool_readFromIndex, mempool_readFull and mempool_writeToIndex these are some of function to access data through these memory sections.

Code tested with 32-bit C Compiler and works as intended and does not support 64-bit compilation. User can modify the variables and bounds accordingly to make it suitable for 64-bit compiler version.
Anyone is free to suggest those modifications as I do not have time to make those changes.
